Test for potential Opti back-end devs: build a coffee vending machine


Welcome
-------

This repository is the starting point for the new OptiRTC .NET developer take-home test. It includes a brief specifications document describing the application you should create to include in your OptiRTC job application. Please follow the Getting Started guide below to submit your application to the OptiRTC development team.

Getting Started
---------------

1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Build your application in accordance with the [Component Specification](https://github.com/OptiRTC/OptiUI-VendingMachine/blob/master/Functional%20Specifications.md), checking in code to your local clone of this repository.
3. Attach a zip file of your complete repository along with your job application.

How you will be evaluated
-------------------------

We are looking for concise and readable code that meets the component specifications. Where the component specifications are ambiguous or lacking, we are looking to see you make a decision that allows you to move forward without compromising the basic functionality of the application. We are expecting this task to take you 1-3 hours; please do not spend more than 5 hours on this task.
